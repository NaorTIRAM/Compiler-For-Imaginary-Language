Compiler For Imaginary Language

I decided to build a compiler using the Bison tool, which is a popular parser generator that can generate code for various programming languages. To create our compiler, i first used the "Flex for Windows" program that i learned in to generate two separate files: cpm.lex and cpm.y, as well as a main file named cpm.c.

The cpm.lex file is responsible for defining the rules that match the lexical units or tokens in the input source code. It breaks down the input code into smaller units called lexemes, which are then passed on to the parser for further processing. These lexemes can include things like keywords, operators, and identifiers. In summary, the cpm.lex file serves as the lexer or scanner for the compiler.

The cpm.y file, on the other hand, contains the parser for the compiler. Its primary task is to analyze the stream of tokens generated by the lexer and use that information to construct a parse tree or abstract syntax tree (AST) that represents the structure of the input program. It does this by defining the grammar rules that specify how the different tokens should be combined to form valid statements or expressions in the language being compiled.

Finally, the cpm.c file acts as the main driver for the compiler, tying together the lexer and parser components. This file contains the main function that reads in the input source code, passes it to the lexer to generate tokens, and then passes those tokens to the parser to generate the AST. The cpm.c file can also contain additional phases of the compilation process, such as code generation or optimization.

How to run:
1. open the cpm.y and cpm.lex in Flex for windows program
2. click on cpm.y and then ctl+3
3. click on cpm.lex and then ctl+1
4. return to cpm.y and ctl+4
5. ctl+6
6. a cmd will open and then write cpm.exe forprintProg.CPL
